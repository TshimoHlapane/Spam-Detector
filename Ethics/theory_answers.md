## 1. What is the difference between TensorFlow and PyTorch?

- **TensorFlow** is developed by Google and offers high performance with strong production support (e.g., TFX, TensorFlow Lite).
- **PyTorch**, developed by Facebook, is more Pythonic and intuitive, widely used in research.

**Key difference**: PyTorch uses dynamic computation graphs (easier to debug), while TensorFlow uses static graphs (better for production deployment).

## 2. When would you choose spaCy over Scikit-learn?

- **spaCy** is ideal for NLP tasks like Named Entity Recognition (NER), POS tagging, and dependency parsing.
- **Scikit-learn** is better for classical ML tasks like classification, regression, and clustering.

**Choose spaCy** when working with raw text and language structure.  
**Choose Scikit-learn** when working with structured/tabular data.

## 3. Define: Transfer Learning and Model Optimization

- **Transfer Learning**: Reusing a pre-trained model on a new, similar task to save training time and improve performance.
- **Model Optimization**: Techniques like pruning, quantization, and early stopping to improve model efficiency and reduce size.

## 4. Pros & Cons of Jupyter Notebook vs Google Colab

| Feature           | Jupyter Notebook       | Google Colab                |
|------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Setup            | Local setup required   | No setup, runs in browser   |
| Compute Power    | Limited to your PC     | Free GPU/TPU available      |
| Sharing          | Manual file sharing    | Easy sharing via links      |
| Storage          | Local files            | Google Drive integration    |

## 5. What are APIs in AI Tools?

APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) in AI allow developers to access pre-trained models or services (e.g., Google Cloud Vision, OpenAI) without rebuilding models from scratch. They help integrate AI into apps quickly.
