# üåç Ethical Reflection ‚Äì Responsible AI Practices 

## 1. Bias in Datasets

AI models can inherit bias from historical data. For example, a spam classifier might wrongly flag messages from certain dialects or regions. This reduces fairness and user trust.

## 2. Fairness and Inclusion

We must ensure the model does not disproportionately misclassify underrepresented groups. Including diverse data and applying fairness constraints helps.

---

## 3. Privacy Concerns

Spam and text classification may involve personal communication. Data must be anonymized and handled with care to respect privacy.

---

## 4. Environmental Consideration

Training large models consumes significant energy. Using optimized architectures and transfer learning can reduce the environmental impact.

---

## 5. Responsible Use

AI should **support** human decision-making, not replace it blindly. Users must understand model limitations and apply human judgment in critical cases.
